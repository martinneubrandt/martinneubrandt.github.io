<h4><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3wpdc2hi6pus3groft4t4/draft-20241210-partnering-for-productivity.pdf?rlkey=jl6xtkrg4sj15ijd3tfg22dml&st=axfq9yq1&dl=0">Partnering for productivity - The impact of cooperation on firm performance</a></h4>

<p align="justify"><i>This paper investigates the impact of cooperation with different partners in innovation activities on firm productivity. The study focuses on the extra productivity gain coming from the collaboration besides innovation. I analyze the panel data of the Hungarian Community Innovation Survey linked to firm balance sheet data, using a long-difference approach. The findings show that four years after the introduction of the innovation, the labor productivity growth of the firm increases by 2.5%, while total factor productivity growth increases by 4.3%. If the firm cooperates vertically with its suppliers or customers in the innovation activity, it adds an extra 3.3% increase to labor productivity growth and 2.9% increase to total factor productivity growth. The results suggest that not only firms close to the technology frontier can benefit from cooperation, but firms introducing only new to the firm innovations also gain from cooperation.</i></p>
