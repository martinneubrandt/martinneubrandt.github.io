<p align=”justify”><i>This paper investigates the impact of cooperation with different types of collaboration partners on firm performance and productivity in Hungary, an emerging innovator country. The
    study focuses on how cooperation facilitates the innovation process and provides access to
    complementary resources. Using a difference-in-differences approach on panel data from the
    Hungarian Community Innovation Survey (CIS) linked to firm balance sheet data, I present an
    empirical analysis of the topic. I find that scientific collaboration partners can increase a firm’s
    TFP growth by 6%-8% after 4 years. In terms of firm performance, both vertical and horizontal partners are important. Collaboration with competitors can increase a firm’s value added
    growth by 5%-6%, while collaboration with both suppliers and customers can increase a firm’s
    sales growth by 5%-6% after 4 years. The findings suggest that policies enhancing collaborations
    among innovators and their stakeholders can improve the quality of innovation in the economy.</i></p>
